        <p>What can I say about this web app ?! Well, it's just an idea that I had to put into practice what I have learnt about Web Scraping in Python.</p>
        <p>So, as you could see, the app is pretty easy to use. On the main page, you have an input where you can write the name of the song of your choice.</p>
        <p>After you press Enter or the Search button, the app starts looking on the web for what you had typed and it uses Google search to do it, so you can write the song the way you want it, as long as Google understands it.</p>
        <p>After some seconds, voilá! A page with some info about the song and the four main links where you can find its lyrics in Brazil will appear.</p>
        <p>I’ve implemented this application in Flask and used BeautifulSoup to do the search thing.</p>
        <p>Yeah, I know it's super simple, but it's a beginning, right?! At least, I had a lot of fun doing it.</p>
        <p>And, if you read this text until here, I really appreciate it. It means a lot ;)</p>
