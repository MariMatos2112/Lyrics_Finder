# Lyrics Finder

## What it is...
This is just an idea that I had to put into practice what I have learnt about Web Scraping in Python.
It's a simple web application that searchs for lyrics of the song you want.

## How to use it...
The app is pretty easy to use. On the main page, you have an input where you can write the name of the song of your choice.
After you press Enter or the Search button, the app starts looking on the web for what you had typed and it uses Google search to do it, so you can write the song the way you want it, as long as Google understands it.
After some seconds, voil√°! A page with some info about the song and the four main links where you can find its lyrics in Brazil will appear.

## What did I use to build it...
* Flask
* Beautiful Soup
* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript
* Heroku
